App receives a list of modules with a few attributes like: 
- term
- engineering area etc.

It also gets a bunch of rules it has to follow. For example:
- must select 4 modules in michaelmas and 4 in lent
- must have at least 1 management module
- must have 2 cw etc

It will output all the possible module choices that abide by those rules.

Extra features:
- for each module selection, show possible alternatives, e.g. selections with only 1 different module. Can use similar strategy to git, that shows in red what is removed and in green what is to be added
- Descriptions of modules
